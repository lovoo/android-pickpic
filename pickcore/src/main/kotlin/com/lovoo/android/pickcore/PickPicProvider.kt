/**
 * Object that allows at runtime to change core feature from PickPic.
 * If you use [com.lovoo.android.pickapp.view.PickPicActivity] you don`t need to provide anything on your own.
 *
 * Please watch out for memory leaks if you provide instances that hold a reference
 * to any UI element such as Activity, Fragment, View...
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * class MyActivity: Activity, ImageEngine, CameraEngine {
 *
 *   override fun onResume() {
 *      super.onResume()
 *      PickPicProvider.imageEngine = this
 *      PickPicProvider.cameraEngine = this
 *      ...
 *   }
 *
 *   override fun onPause() {
 *      super.onPause()
 *      PickPicProvider.imageEngine = DefaultImageEngine() // remove Activity reference
 *      PickPicProvider.cameraEngine = DisabledCameraEngine() // remove Activity reference
 *      ...
 *   }
 *
 *   ...
 * }
 *
 * As you can see in the example the reference will be cleared in onDestroy.
 * But I want to encourage you to use a stand-alone Engine class without any UI reference.
 * And even if you do so please consider the issue with singleton instance and Lifecycle.
 * For example an Activity set an engine in onCreate and clears it in onDestroy, when two
 * such Activities are created then the engine from Activity A will be overwritten by Activity B.
 * Or worse Activity B will clear the engine in onDestroy and Activity A is just resumed.
 *
 * Best would be to use [com.lovoo.android.pickapp.view.PickPicActivity] as singleInstance
 * or set engine within your Application.onCreate() call.
