`PickPicCaptureFragment()`

Ready to use solution to handle Android Camera capture.

Use PickPicCaptureFragment.start() and let your [Activity](#)
or parent [Fragment](#) implement [CaptureCallback](#).

It is based on [DialogFragment](#) and will be visible
shortly as an overlay.

Modify pickapp proguard rules as well when package is changed or class is renamed!!!
