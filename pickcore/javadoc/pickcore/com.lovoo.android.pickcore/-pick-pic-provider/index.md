# PickPicProvider

`object PickPicProvider` [(source)](https://github.com/lovoo/android-pickpic/blob/master/pickcore/pickcore/src/main/kotlin/com/lovoo/android/pickcore/PickPicProvider.kt#L62)

Object that allows at runtime to change core feature from PickPic.
If you use [com.lovoo.android.pickapp.view.PickPicActivity](#) you don`t need to provide anything on your own.

Please watch out for memory leaks if you provide instances that hold a reference
to any UI element such as Activity, Fragment, View...

Example:

class MyActivity: Activity, ImageEngine, CameraEngine {

override fun onResume() {
    super.onResume()
    PickPicProvider.imageEngine = this
    PickPicProvider.cameraEngine = this
    ...
}

override fun onPause() {
    super.onPause()
    PickPicProvider.imageEngine = DefaultImageEngine() // remove Activity reference
    PickPicProvider.cameraEngine = DisabledCameraEngine() // remove Activity reference
    ...
}

...
}

As you can see in the example the reference will be cleared in onDestroy.
But I want to encourage you to use a stand-alone Engine class without any UI reference.
And even if you do so please consider the issue with singleton instance and Lifecycle.
For example an Activity set an engine in onCreate and clears it in onDestroy, when two
such Activities are created then the engine from Activity A will be overwritten by Activity B.
Or worse Activity B will clear the engine in onDestroy and Activity A is just resumed.

Best would be to use [com.lovoo.android.pickapp.view.PickPicActivity](#) as singleInstance
or set engine within your Application.onCreate() call.

### Properties

| Name | Summary |
|---|---|
| [cameraEngine](camera-engine.md) | `var cameraEngine: `[`CameraEngine`](../../com.lovoo.android.pickcore.contract/-camera-engine/index.md)<br>[CameraEngine](../../com.lovoo.android.pickcore.contract/-camera-engine/index.md) that defines if the camera will be available for a certain [Gallery](#). Please consider to keep the user flow consistent. Its a bad experience when the user navigate to a custom folder, used the camera button there and the taken picture is added to the DCIM or another folder. It would be better to show the camera button only in Galleries were you can save the picture, so that it appears afterwards. |
| [imageEngine](image-engine.md) | `var imageEngine: `[`ImageEngine`](../../com.lovoo.android.pickcore.contract/-image-engine/index.md)<br>[ImageEngine](../../com.lovoo.android.pickcore.contract/-image-engine/index.md) that is used from PickPic to load images as thumbnails and preview. Should be set at soon as possible |
| [selectionHolder](selection-holder.md) | `var selectionHolder: `[`SelectionHolder`](../../com.lovoo.android.pickcore.contract/-selection-holder/index.md)`?`<br>[SelectionHolder](../../com.lovoo.android.pickcore.contract/-selection-holder/index.md) implementation that keeps track of the selected [Picture](#)s and provides the option to listen for changes. |
